- Based on my memories from the first PC game that I played called Nibble (or Nibbles?) written for DOS I think in Basic.
- Recreated the first 5 levels that I remember, very easy to add new levels
  (see s:InitLevel() function).
- Use :Nibble command to start the game.
- Use 'h', 'j', 'k' and 'l' keys to control the direction of the snake and
  drive it on to the aim (call it a sleeping mouse :).
- Use 'q' to quit, <C-C> or <C-Break> to stop and <Space> to pause.
- You have 3 lives to expend. The current number of lives, level and the score
  is displayed.
- If the snake touches the border, the blocks or itself you loose a life.
- Game ends when all the lives are consumed or you complete all the levels.

Good exerciese to practice hjkl key movements, even for experienced Vi users,
as you need to sometimes react very quickly.
